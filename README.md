🧹 Data Preparation
Before creating the dashboard in Excel, the following data cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed:

✅ Data Cleaning:

🔍 Data Formatting & Validation:
Ensured all date columns were in proper date format.
Verified numerical columns (e.g., claim amounts) were correctly formatted as currency/number types.
Checked and corrected data types for all fields to avoid issues in chart rendering and filtering.
